# Introduction to Kubernetes
## Official Definition of Kubernetes
- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration engine designed for the automating the deployment, scaling and management of contanerized applications. This open-source project is hosted by the Cloud Native Foundation (CNCF)
## Understanding of Kubernetes and Docker
- To grasp kubernetes also known as K8s, its essential to have a foundation in docker. In docker we deploy our applications inside the containers. However, in Kubernetes we mange conatiners on larger scale, often numbering in thousands or more, depending on the applications traffic.
## Visualizing Docker and Kubernetes
- In Docker, imagine a ship containing containers.
- Now in Kubernetes picture the smae ship but ths time, it has steering wheel. Just like the captian operates the sheep's wheel to make decisions about its course, Kubernetes acts as the "ship wheel" for the managing containers.
- Kubernetes is an open-source platform, meaning its source code is freely available fot anyone to use, modify and redistribute.
## What are Monolithic Architecture and Microservices Architecture?
### Montolithic Architecture:
- Imagine a restaurant where everything happens in one big kitchen. This kitchen handles taking orders, cooking food, and serving customers all in a sigle place.
- In thi scenario, if the kitchen get too crowded or if there/s a problem with one part of the kitchen, it can affect the entire reataurants operation.
- If the chek=f is sick the entirw kitchen may come to halt, impacting the entire dining experience.
### Microservices Architecture:
- Now consider food delivery service like Zomato or swiggy. Instead of one big kitchen, they have network of different restaurants, each specializing in a specific type of regional foor or Cuisine.
- When you place an orderm its not prepared in single kitchen rather, each restaurant (mircorservice) prepares its own portion of the order. These portions are then assembked and delivered to you.
- If one restaurant has an issue, it doesnt necessarily impact the others.
- For example: if the burger place is busy, it wont affect the rolls restaurants abiltiy to fulfill orders.
### *Key Diffrences*
- Monotlithic arhitecture is like single kitchen handling al tasks, while micoservices architecture is multiple specialized restaurants working together.
- Monoliths are typically easier to setup and mange initially, while microservices offer more flexibility and scalability.
- Monoliths can have a single point of failure, while microservices are more fault-tolerant beacause a failure in one microservice doesnt necessarily affect the others.
- In the end, kubernetes helps in one microservice-based architecture which is good for business aspects, etc.

## Why do we need Kubernetes?
* After Docker came into the picture, the edeployment of the applications was very easy on the containers beacause containers are very ligthweight. But after some time there were a lot of issues arose such as managing the huge amount of containers in the Production environment where Containers failed leading to huge Business losses.
  ### *After Kubernetes came, it automates many tasks such as:*
  * *Autoscaling of Containers according to the peak or normal hours.*
  * *Load balancing of multiple containers.*
  * *Automatically deployment of containers to the available nodes in the cluster.*
  * *Self-healing if containers fail.*

## Kubernetes Origins and Open Source:
- Kubernetes was created by Google in 2013 in Golang. Initially, Kubernetes was not open source but in 2014, google introduced Kubernetes open Source and donated to CNCF.
## Languages Supported by Kubernetes
- Kubernetes suports both YAML and JSON for configuration.

## Features of Kubernetes
- Auto Scalling: Kubernetes supports two types of autoscaling horizontal and vertical scaling for large-scale production environments which helps to reduce the downtime of the applications.
- Auto Healing: Kubernetes supports auto healing which means if the containers fail or are stopped due to any issues, with the help of Kubernetes components (which will talk in upcoming days), containers will automatically repaired or heal and run again properly.
- Load Balancing: With the help of Load Balancing, Kubernetes distributes the traffic between two or more containers.
- Platform Independent: Kubernetes can work on any type of infrastructure whether its On-premises, Virtual Machines or any Cloud.
- Fault Tolerance: Kubernetes helps to notify nodes or pods failures and create new pods or containers as soon as possible.
- Rollback: You can switch to previous version.
- Health Monitoring: of COntainers: Regularly check the health of the monitor and if any conatiner fails, create a new container.
- Orchestration: Suppose three containers are running on different networks (On premises, Virtual Machines and on the Cloud). Kubernetes can create cluster that has all three containers from different Networks.
### *Alternatives of Kubernetes*
- Docker Swarm
- Apache Mesos
- Openshift
- Nomad, etc.
- *We dont need to know the other alternative in depth except Docker Swarm as our main focus is Kubernetes.*
