- Kubernetes follows client-server architecture where the Master Node and Worker node exist which constitutes a 'Kubernetes Cluster'. We can have multiple worker nodes and master nodes according to the requirement.
## Control Plane
- The control plane components, including the API server, etcd, scheduler and controller manager, are typically on the master node(s) of Kubernetes Cluster.
- These components are responsible for managing and cotrolling the cluster as a whole.
