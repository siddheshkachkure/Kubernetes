# Kubernetes Architecture - Master Node

- Kubernetes follows client-server architecture where the Master Node and Worker node exist which constitutes a 'Kubernetes Cluster'. We can have multiple worker nodes and master nodes according to the requirement.
## Control Plane
- The control plane components, including the API server, etcd, scheduler and controller manager, are typically on the master node(s) of Kubernetes Cluster.
- These components are responsible for managing and cotrolling the cluster as a whole.

## Master Node
  - The master node is resposible for the entire cluster and manages all the activities inside the cluster in which master nodes communicate with the worker node to run the appliations on the containers smoothly. Master Node has four primary components which help to manage all the things that we have discussed earlier:
    1. API Server:
       - In Simple terms, after installing the kubectl on the master node developers run the commands to create pods.
       -  So the command will go to the API server and then the API server forwards it to that component which will help to create the pods.
       -  In other words, the API server is an entry point for any Kubernetes task where the API server follows the hierarchical approach to implement the things.
    2. Etcd:
